Fiddling around with deterministic stroke recognition, learning project for Obj-C. Discontinued :)

Started out using character recognition with tesseract, but quickly figured I didn't need it for the usecase, and serializing stroke data would be enough.

Built and tested on iPad Air, probably has horrible autolayout issues. Some test characters work, but the stroke serialization needs some fine tuning.
Project dropped for the time being.
